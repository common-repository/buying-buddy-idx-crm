== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is IDX? =

The term "IDX" is an acronym of Internet Data eXchange. 

IDX allows Brokers and Associate Brokers to display all homes for sale listed in their MLS, on their personal real estate websites. For most MLS areas, this includes coming-soon, pending, and sold properties, too. Many MLS also include rental properties as part of their IDX.

Because IDX is considered advertising, each agent (with the permission of their managing broker) can present all listings through their website to any visitor without the need for the visitor to agree to any formal terms and conditions.

The concept of IDX is simple: It's a reciprocal agreement. Each participating broker contributes their listings to the IDX database (they opt-in) and is in turn able to display listings from all other participating brokers on their website.
These days, practically all listings from your MLS are now included with IDX.

**Did you know?**

NAR made reciprocal Internet Data eXchange a mandatory policy effective Jan 1, 2002.
Buying Buddy was one of the very first solutions created to incorporate IDX.

= Benefits of IDX =

IDX is one of the most amazing assets any real estate agent or broker has to aid their marketing and sales.
You can [exploit the entire MLS](https://buyingbuddy.com/real-estate-marketing.php) for your own marketing benefit. 
For example:

- Use any or all listings in the MLS to highlight your own listings, knowledge, and expertise
- Give your clients and prospects an advanced property search on your own website, branded to you
- Showcase your own listings - both active and sold
- Create multiple landing pages to present different types of properties or focus on neighborhoods and market areas
- Use listings and search services to capture leads

= How do I add IDX to My Website? =

Buying Buddy provides the simplest and fastest way to add IDX and MLS to your website.

**Install IDX Plugin**

Follow the installation instructions to add Buying Buddy to your website.
You will be able to immediately see the plugin in action by searching for and viewing properties.

**Do More**

Use the Buying Buddy shortcodes to add more MLS and marketing content all over your real estate website. 
The Wizards in your Buying Buddy dashboard will generate the shortcodes you need to show filtered properties in a grid, list, or map, wherever you want.

= Is there a free trial? =

Yes. Install the plugin and follow the instructions provided in the activation process.

= Will Buying Buddy IDX Work with my WordPress Theme? =

Buying Buddy can be added as a plugin to any WordPress theme, and works with any theme and all WordPress builders such as Elementor, DIVI, etc.

Please note that Buying Buddy widgets include all the HTML and CSS to generate layouts, so you do not need (and we do not recommend) real estate-specific themes. 

= Can I customize the widgets to match my website theme? =

The Buying Buddy widgets can be easily styled with Widget Themes.
The selected widget theme will apply colors and styling to all your Buying Buddy widgets.

Create widget themes with your own custom styling to perfectly match the design and theme of your website.
The widget CSS is also fully available for advanced customization if you wish.

= Do I need a database for MLS data, leads and users? =

No. The Buying Buddy plugin communicates with our servers to get all listing data and process all inquiries and lead activity.
Nothing is hosted on your WordPress site. 
You do not need any special technical capabilities, databases, or resources.

Your Buying Buddy account dashboard and CRM is accessed through our website.

= If I switch to Buying Buddy can I keep existing slugs? =

The foundation pages for "search results" and "property details" will be created with default slugs.
These can be changed as long as the website settings in your Buying Buddy account are updated to match.
  
= Will Buying Buddy IDX Show My Listings? =

Yes. We use a "filter" added to the shortcodes to display specific properties.

For example, to display a grid of properties, the shortcode to use is:
~~~~
[mbb_widget id='MBBv3_FeaturedGallery']
~~~~
To display properties only in zip code 80222 and over $400,000 we add a filter, like this:
~~~~
[mbb_widget id='MBBv3_FeaturedGallery' filter='zip_code:80222+price_min:400000']
~~~~
The Wizard in your Buying Buddy account dashboard lets you use any MLS field and will generate the shortcode with a filter for you.

Just copy and paste to your web page.

= How can I integrate MLS search and add listings to my website? =

Buying Buddy IDX Plugin has a set of shortcodes that add MLS searches, properties, and other functions to your website pages - all with the most up-to-date listings from your MLS.

The shortcodes can include additional filters that specify the properties you want to display, such as your sold properties or listings in a certain area, with a pool and so on.

The Buying Buddy Dashboard provides Wizards that generate these shortcodes and filters for you. You just select what you want to see, copy the code, and paste it on the page you want to see it on.

= Does Buying Buddy Create SEO-Friendly Content? =

Buying Buddy will automatically generate pages for each property on your WordPress website. All MLS properties are given a unique long-tail URL property details page with SEO content (page titles, keywords, and metadata) that include title-tags, meta-tags, og-tags, and keywords.

Buying Buddy's SEO technology has been in use since 2010. Our technology makes listing pages search engine friendly. All the information on listing pages is integrated with your website.

= Can I add IDX with WordPress shortcodes? =

Buying Buddy IDX components are added to your WordPress pages using traditional WordPress shortcodes (with square brackets). This means that the IDX widgets can be embedded into the existing content of your WordPress posts and pages.

Buying Buddy does not generate cookie-cutter page templates or page layouts.

Embeddable IDX widgets allow a flexible, creative design of real estate landing pages with any other content, tailored for your own marketing.

Now you can add MLS content to any WordPress page type, including blog posts. So, if you have a blog article about a neighborhood, you can add a Buying Buddy IDX widget to display some of the latest properties for sale, or sold, in that neighborhood.

= Can I add IDX to my WordPress blog posts / articles? =

Yes. If you can add a shortcode to a "post", "page", or "article" or widget area in WordPress then you can display properties.

= Do I need to use Yoast or All In One SEO for indexable IDX listings? =

We recommend using an SEO plugin with your WordPress real estate website, such as Yoast or AIOSEO.

Buying Buddy Wordpress IDX plugin will override the meta tags on the designated "property details" page so that each property page has unique meta tags.

= How is the IDX content hosted and updated? =

Buying Buddy servers continually update all MLS data from your MLS using Web API (RESO) methods.

The Buying Buddy widgets use AJAX to load data from our servers when your webpages load. 

No data is stored on your server.
